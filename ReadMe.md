# R_HealthCare_Data_Challange_LogisticRegression-NaiveBayes

1. Please set working directory to source file. 

2. Since Dataset really large, please download through this link from Google drive:

3. Also, in original data, we have 1000 features, so my program gonna run for a while, thank you for waiting.

4. Possible Improvement 
EDA. Know about features distribution. This part may also leads to the failure of logistic regression, cause I didnâ€™t check assumptions. 
Feature Engineering. Use random forest to get some knowledge of possible important features before using PCA reducing feature dimension.
